This project is an iOS application built in Swift. It is designed to give various information on different clubs and bars within the nearby area of the user. Its main functionality is to show the live capacity of each venue, which can be updated through the separate venue section of the application.

This project was created for my university third year individual project. It is currently incomplete, and the current code will likely need updating to make it more clear and concise - as this was made when I first started learning Swift.
